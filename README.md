# Talent-Time-Counter
This is for creating a count up timer for a specific task

## IDEA
* Create a website that will count up from the time we entered
* The idea is taken from website page created by [avinashboy](https://github.com/avinashboy)


## Needed logics from the base HTML
* distance = now - countDownDate
    - distance - is the difference between the dates
    - countDownDate - This is date we are starting
    - now - the realtime of the user

### Forntend format
```
{
          basetime: "May 28, 2021 00:00:00",
          title: `project 1`,
          id: 1,
	      stopwatch: 00:00:00,
}
```
